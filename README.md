# Chobits-Translation-Project
A project aimed at translating the game Chobits: Chiidake no Hito for the PS2 into English. Currently, 99% of the ingame text is translated and all video cutscenes are subtitled. The audio is still in Japanese, and some UI elements are not translated.

### How to Install:

1. Obtain a copy of 'Chobits - Chiidake no Hito [NTSC-J] [SLPM-65255]' for the PS2. For copyright reasons this cannot be distributed here.
2. Download your preferred copy of the mod from the releases section: https://github.com/sam8457/Chobits-Translation-Project/releases . I recommend the 'With Video' option.
3. Download a program to patch the game, such as DeltaPatcher: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/ , https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher , though any that can handle .xdelta files will work.
4. Run the program and select your original disk image under 'Original file'. Select the .xdelta file under 'XDelta patch'.
5. Click 'Apply Patch', it should take 5-10 seconds to modify the file. By default DeltaPatcher will overwrite the original.

Once that's done, boot up the game and have fun!
